# Setting

The story takes place in a small, seemingly ordinary town that exists on multiple layers of reality. The library serves as a nexus point where different layers intersect, making it a place of power and danger.

The "layers" are parallel realities that overlap with our own, each with its own rules, inhabitants, and magic. Path-Walkers can move between these layers, but doing so requires skill, training, and the guidance of the Book of Paths.
