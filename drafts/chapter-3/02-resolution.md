"The world you know is only one layer of reality," Ms. Chen explained. "The Book of Paths connects all the layers. You, Alex, are a Path-Walker—someone who can move between them."

Alex looked at the map, now understanding its true purpose. "What do I need to do?"

"Walk the path," Ms. Chen said simply. "The book will guide you, but the choice is yours. You can return to your normal life, or you can step into a world of magic and danger."

Alex took a deep breath and reached for the book. The choice was already made.
