The next morning, Ms. Chen explained about the Watchers—beings from the deepest layers who monitored Path-Walkers. Some were protectors, but others sought to control or eliminate those who could navigate between realities.

"They're drawn to new Path-Walkers like moths to flame," she said, setting up protective wards around the sanctuary. "Until you learn to shield yourself, you're vulnerable."

Alex watched as she drew symbols in the air, each one leaving a faint trail of light. "Can you teach me to do that?"

"Eventually. First, you must learn to walk the paths. Only then can you defend yourself properly."

The urgency in her voice made Alex nervous. "How much time do we have?"

Ms. Chen's silence was answer enough.
