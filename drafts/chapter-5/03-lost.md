Something went wrong on the third path-walk. Alex focused on the wrong symbol, and suddenly the world shifted in an unexpected direction. The library vanished, replaced by a vast, empty space filled with floating geometric shapes.

"Ms. Chen?" Alex called out, but there was no answer. The map was still in hand, but the symbols had changed, rearranged into an unfamiliar pattern.

Panic set in. Alex was lost between layers, with no idea how to get back. The geometric shapes began to move closer, and Alex realized they weren't shapes at all—they were creatures, and they were curious.

One approached, extending what might have been a limb. Alex backed away, but there was nowhere to go in this endless void.
