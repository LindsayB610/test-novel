Just as the creatures closed in, a familiar voice cut through the void. "Focus on the map, Alex! Find the symbol for home!"

Ms. Chen's voice was strained, distant, but clear. Alex looked down at the map, searching frantically through the rearranged symbols. There—one that felt familiar, that resonated with the memory of the library.

Alex focused on it, pouring all concentration into that single symbol, and stepped forward.

The void collapsed. Alex stumbled back into the sanctuary, falling to hands and knees. Ms. Chen was there, looking exhausted, her hands still glowing with protective magic.

"You're safe," she said, helping Alex up. "But that was too close. We need to be more careful."
