The first path-walk was terrifying. Ms. Chen guided Alex to a specific symbol on the map, then instructed Alex to focus on it while stepping forward.

The world dissolved. For a moment, Alex existed in nothingness, then reality reformed—but different. The library was still there, but the books were written in languages that hurt to look at, and the shadows moved with purpose.

"This is the second layer," Ms. Chen's voice came from beside Alex, though she looked slightly transparent. "Here, everything is more... aware. The books remember their readers. The walls know their history."

Alex reached out to touch a bookshelf, and it recoiled. "It's alive?"

"In a way. Everything has more presence here. You must be respectful, or the layer will reject you."
