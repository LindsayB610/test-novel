As Alex prepared to leave, a figure appeared in the library's main reading room—tall, cloaked in shadows that seemed to move independently. The air grew cold, and the normal sounds of the library faded to silence.

Ms. Chen's hand shot out, gripping Alex's arm. "Don't look at it directly. Don't acknowledge it. Walk slowly to the exit."

Alex's heart hammered, but followed Ms. Chen's instructions. The figure didn't move, but Alex could feel its attention, like a weight pressing down.

Once outside, Ms. Chen's expression was grim. "They know. The Watchers have sensed your awakening. We need to accelerate your training."
