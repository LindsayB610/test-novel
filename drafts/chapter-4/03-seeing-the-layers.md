For hours, Ms. Chen guided Alex through exercises. First, simply observing the layers without trying to interact. Then, learning to distinguish between them—the mundane layer where most people lived, the shadow layer where things were slightly off, and the deeper layers that pulsed with raw power.

"Each layer has its own rules," Ms. Chen warned. "Break them, and you could be trapped. Or worse."

Alex's head ached from the effort, but something was clicking into place. The map's symbols began to make sense, each one representing a different layer, a different path.

"Good," Ms. Chen nodded approvingly. "You're learning faster than most. But speed can be dangerous. Tomorrow, we'll practice moving between layers. Today, rest."
