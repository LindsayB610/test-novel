Alex returned to the library three days later, the map carefully folded in a pocket. Ms. Chen was waiting at the front desk, her expression unreadable.

"You've come back," she said, not looking up from the book she was cataloging. "I knew you would."

"How did you know?" Alex asked, approaching cautiously.

Ms. Chen finally looked up, her dark eyes seeming to see right through Alex. "The book chooses its own keepers. And once chosen, the path cannot be ignored."

She closed her catalog and gestured toward the back of the library. "Come. We have much to discuss, and little time."
