They came just as the convergence began to peak. Dozens of Watchers, their shadowy forms solidifying in the grove. Some stood guard, but others moved with purpose, heading toward the barrier's weak points.

"They're trying to prevent us from anchoring," Ms. Chen realized, her voice tight with alarm. "They want the barriers to fall completely."

Alex watched in horror as the Watchers began to attack the barriers directly, their shadowy forms tearing at the fragile membranes. Each tear made the convergence worse, pulling more layers into alignment.

"We have to stop them!" Alex shouted, moving forward, but Ms. Chen grabbed Alex's arm.

"Not yet. Wait for my signal. The barriers need to be at their weakest before we anchor, or the anchors won't hold. But if we wait too long..."

She didn't finish. She didn't need to. The grove was filling with creatures from other layers now, drawn through the tears. The situation was spiraling out of control.
