The grove existed in a space between spaces. Trees grew in impossible geometries, their branches reaching into multiple layers simultaneously. The air hummed with power, and Alex could feel the barriers here—thin, fragile membranes that separated realities.

"This is a natural convergence point," Ms. Chen explained, setting up a circle of anchors around the grove's center. "The barriers are always weaker here. During a convergence, they become nearly transparent."

Already, Alex could see through them—glimpses of other worlds, other realities. Some beautiful, some terrifying, all alien.

"The convergence will peak in three hours," Ms. Chen continued. "When it does, you'll need to create anchors at each of the barrier's weak points. I'll guide you, but the actual anchoring must be done by you. The barriers respond to new Path-Walkers more readily than experienced ones."

"Why?"

"Because you're still connected to the mundane layer. Your anchors will be stronger, more stable. It's why the Watchers are so interested in you—and why you're our best hope."
