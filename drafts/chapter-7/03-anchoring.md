"Now!" Ms. Chen's voice cut through the chaos.

Alex moved, focusing on the first weak point. The map glowed in hand, showing exactly where to anchor. Alex reached out, pouring will and focus into creating an anchor at the barrier's weakest spot.

It took. The barrier stabilized, the tear sealing shut. One down.

But there were more—six more weak points, and the Watchers were attacking each one. Alex moved to the next, then the next, creating anchors as fast as possible while Ms. Chen fought off the creatures that had already crossed through.

Each anchor was harder than the last. Alex's energy was draining, and the barriers were becoming more unstable. At the fifth anchor, Alex stumbled, vision blurring.

"Keep going!" Ms. Chen called out, her voice strained. "Just two more!"

Alex pushed forward, reaching for the sixth anchor point. The barrier here was nearly gone, and Alex could see something massive moving through from the other side—something that should never cross into this reality.
