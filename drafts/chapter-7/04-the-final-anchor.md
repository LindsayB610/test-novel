The seventh anchor point was the hardest. The barrier was almost completely gone, and the thing on the other side was pushing through. Alex could feel its presence—vast, ancient, hungry.

But this was it. The final anchor. If Alex could place it, all seven would resonate together, reinforcing the entire barrier system and sealing the convergence.

Alex focused everything—all remaining energy, all will, all determination—into that single point. The anchor formed, glowing bright, and suddenly all seven anchors connected, their power flowing together.

The barriers snapped back into place. The convergence reversed. The creatures that had crossed through were pulled back, and the Watchers howled in frustration before fading away.

Alex collapsed, exhausted, but the grove was quiet again. The barriers were stable. The convergence was over.

Ms. Chen helped Alex to their feet. "You did it. You saved us. All of us."

Alex looked around at the peaceful grove, the barriers now strong and stable. "What happens now?"

"Now?" Ms. Chen smiled. "Now you're a real Path-Walker. And there's so much more to learn."
