A week passed. Alex's path-walking improved steadily, but the Watchers became more frequent. They appeared at the edges of vision, in reflections, sometimes even in dreams.

"They're testing your defenses," Ms. Chen explained one evening. "Trying to find a weakness. We need to move to the next phase of your training."

She produced another book from a locked cabinet—this one bound in what looked like living wood, its pages made of something that wasn't quite paper. "The Book of Anchors. This will teach you to create safe points between layers, places you can always return to."

Alex reached for it, but Ms. Chen pulled it back. "Not yet. First, you must understand why this is necessary. The Watchers aren't just monitoring you—they're preparing something. Something big."

"What are they preparing?"

Ms. Chen's expression darkened. "A convergence. Multiple layers aligning. When it happens, the barriers between realities will be thin enough for almost anyone to cross. And not everyone who crosses should."
