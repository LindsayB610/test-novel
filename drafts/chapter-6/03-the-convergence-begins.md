The first sign of the convergence came on a Tuesday. Alex was at school, sitting in history class, when the world flickered. For just a second, the classroom was something else—a vast chamber with stone walls and strange symbols carved into them.

No one else seemed to notice, but Alex's heart raced. The convergence was starting.

After school, Alex rushed to the library. Ms. Chen was already there, surrounded by protective wards that glowed with urgent light.

"It's begun," she said without preamble. "The barriers are weakening faster than I expected. We have days, maybe hours, before the full convergence."

"What happens then?"

"Then the layers will be open. Anyone can cross. Anything can cross. And we need to be ready to close them again, or this reality will be overrun."

Alex felt the weight of responsibility settle. "What do I need to do?"

Ms. Chen handed over the Book of Anchors. "Learn. Fast. Because when the convergence peaks, you'll need to anchor the barriers themselves. And if you fail..."

She didn't finish the sentence. She didn't need to.
