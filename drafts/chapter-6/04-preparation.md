The next forty-eight hours were a blur of intense training. Alex learned to create multiple anchors, to sense the barriers between layers, to understand their structure and how to reinforce them.

The Watchers became more aggressive. They no longer just observed—they tested, probed, sometimes attacked. Ms. Chen's wards held, but they were being strained.

"We can't stay here much longer," she said on the second night. "The sanctuary is becoming a beacon. We need to move to a secondary location."

She showed Alex a new symbol on the map—one that led to a place Alex had never seen, a hidden grove that existed between layers, accessible only to Path-Walkers.

"Tomorrow, we go there," Ms. Chen said. "And tomorrow, you'll face your first real test. The convergence will reach its peak, and you'll need to help anchor the barriers. Are you ready?"

Alex wasn't sure, but nodded anyway. Ready or not, there was no turning back now.
