Creating an anchor was harder than path-walking. It required not just seeing the layers, but understanding their structure, finding a point of stability that existed across multiple realities.

Alex spent days trying, failing, trying again. The sanctuary became a second home, and Ms. Chen's patience never wavered.

"Feel for the intersection," she would say. "Where the layers touch, there's always a point of connection. That's your anchor."

On the fifth day, something clicked. Alex found a point in the library's reference section where all the layers seemed to converge—a single spot where reality felt most stable. Focusing on it, Alex reached out with will alone and... anchored it.

The sensation was indescribable. The spot glowed faintly, visible only to Alex, and suddenly there was a connection, a tether that could never be broken.

"I did it," Alex whispered, amazed.

Ms. Chen smiled, a rare expression. "Yes. You did. Now you have a safe place. But you'll need more than one."
